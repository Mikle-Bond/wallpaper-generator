# wallpaper-generator

A simple wallpaper generator in python, to have fun with graphics and python.

Creates a lattice of rectangles of random colors, and applies random mutations on the vertices of those rectangles to give a nice effect. Right now it just looks psychedelic but with the right colors it might become nice.

Inspired by [this kind of wallpaper](http://imgur.com/m5tjwjp).
